### 🎬 Cinema Audience Forecasting – Machine Learning Project
A **regression-based machine learning project** focused on predicting cinema audience count using historical booking and theater data.

**Problem Statement**
Accurately forecasting audience count helps cinema operators optimize:
- Screen allocation  
- Show timings  
- Revenue planning  

The goal was to build a robust ML model to predict **audience_count** for future dates.

**🔍 What I Did (Based on Notebook)**

**Data Understanding & EDA**
- Loaded and explored multiple relational datasets  
- Analyzed booking trends, theater-level patterns, and date-based effects  
- Checked data shapes, distributions, and missing values  

**Feature Engineering & Preprocessing**
- Combined numerical and categorical features  
- Used **ColumnTransformer** for:
  - One-hot encoding categorical variables  
  - Scaling numerical features  
- Built a clean preprocessing + modeling pipeline  

**Modeling Approach**
- Implemented regression models using **Scikit-learn pipelines**  
- Used **train-validation strategy** and time-aware considerations  
- Optimized models using:
  - GridSearchCV  
  - RandomizedSearchCV  

**Evaluation**
- Used **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** as the evaluation metric  
- Compared multiple models and selected the best-performing one  

**Prediction & Submission**
- Generated predictions on test data  
- Applied post-processing:
  - Clipping negative values  
  - Rounding predictions to integers  
- Created final **submission.csv** for evaluation
